# Popular Movies -- Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree project #2! :)

This app fetchs data from The Movie DB (https://www.themoviedb.org) to display a list of movies. The list can be sorted by "Top rated" or "Popular".

When you select a movie, you can visualize its details, such as user score, release date, synopsis, trailers and user reviews.
You can also bookmark it, and create a list with your favorite movies!

In order to run the app, an API key from The Movie DB is needed. You can get one on their website: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api. Then, set it as a value for the THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY property in the gradle.properties file:
